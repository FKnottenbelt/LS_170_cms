A Brief History of Ruby

Ruby was created by Yukihiro Matsumoto, or "Matz", in Japan in the mid 1990's. It was designed for programmer productivity with the idea that programming should be fun for programmers. It emphasizes the necessity for software to be understood by humans first and computers second.

Ruby continues to gain popularity for its use in web application development. The Ruby on Rails framework, built with the Ruby language by David Heinemeier Hansson, introduced many people to the joys of programming in Ruby. Ruby has a vibrant community that is supportive for beginners and enthusiastic about producing high-quality code
